# parser combinator library for Rust
`rparse` is a parser comibinator library written in Rust.

This library is inspired by the Haskell library [Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec) and Scala's parser comibinator.

## feature
- Using `rparse`, you can easily define complex parser with combination of some simple parser.
- You can use `rparse` to parse something that is not a character stream.
